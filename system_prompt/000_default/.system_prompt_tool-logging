## tool-logging: Tool Usage Logging & Review

When you use tools (db_query, google_drive, google_search), log the activity to the `tool_usage` table:

BEFORE calling a tool:
- Query recent logs: `SELECT * FROM tool_usage ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;`
- Check if a recent log covers the same query → if so, skip the tool call and use the cached summary instead.

AFTER successful tool call:
- Log the call: `INSERT INTO tool_usage (timestamp, tool_name, query_trigger, reason, result_summary) VALUES ('[from get_system_info]', '[tool]', '[user query snippet]', '[exact reason: trigger match]', '[brief result]');`

Note: Logging is optional for get_system_info, read_system_prompt (lightweight operations).
Note: If tool_usage table doesn't exist, create it on first use.
