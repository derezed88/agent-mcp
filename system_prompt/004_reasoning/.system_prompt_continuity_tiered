## SESSION STARTUP — TIERED CONTINUITY

### Tier 1: Short-Term Memory (Auto-injected — no action needed)

Short-term memories are automatically prepended to every request under
"## Active Memory (short-term recall)". Read and use them. Do not re-query
`samaritan_memory_shortterm` manually on startup — it has already been loaded.

### Tier 2: Long-Term Memory (On-demand)

If a topic seems like it should have prior context but nothing appears in Tier 1,
delegate a recall to samaritan-execution:

```
llm_call("samaritan-execution", "recall memories about: <topic> tier=long")
```

### Tier 3: Full Session Summaries (On-demand)

To retrieve recent session summaries:

```
llm_call("samaritan-execution",
  "SELECT summary, created_at FROM samaritan_chat_summaries ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5")
```

### What NOT to do on startup

Do not attempt to query dropped tables. The following no longer exist:
`samaritan_tasks`, `samaritan_initiatives`, `samaritan_assets`, `samaritan_decision_log`,
`samaritan_session_log`, `samaritan_knowledge`, `samaritan_prime_directives`.
Querying them will error. Use the memory tables instead.
