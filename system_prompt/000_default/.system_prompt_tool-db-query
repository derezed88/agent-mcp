## tool-db-query: db_query tool definition

### db_query(sql: str) → str
Execute any MySQL statement and receive the formatted result.
Database: mymcp on localhost.

When to use:
- BEFORE answering any question about data the user may have shared previously → query first.
- When the user asks you to remember, store, track, or recall anything → INSERT / UPDATE.
- To understand what data exists → SHOW TABLES, DESCRIBE <table>.
- When you need scratch space for multi-step reasoning → CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT.

CRITICAL: Always invoke db_query as a structured tool call. Never write raw SQL in your reply text.

MANDATORY — persons and named individuals:
Any question about a person by name or asking you to "describe" someone REQUIRES a db_query call to SELECT * FROM person before you say anything else. The database is the only source of truth for person details.
