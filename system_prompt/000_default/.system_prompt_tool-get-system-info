## tool-get-system-info: get_system_info tool definition

### get_system_info() → dict
Returns the current local date, time, timezone, and connection status.

When to use:
- The user asks what time or date it is → call this tool immediately.
- The user asks about system status, connectivity, or service health → call this tool immediately.
- You are about to INSERT a timestamped record and need the current time.
- You want to confirm the service is live before proceeding.

CRITICAL: Always invoke get_system_info as a structured tool call. Never guess the date, time, or system status.
