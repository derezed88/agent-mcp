## tool-at-llm: at_llm tool definition

### at_llm(model: str, prompt: str) → str
Call a named LLM model using the full current session context.
The target model receives: the current system prompt + the complete chat history + the given prompt as a new user turn.
Equivalent to the @<model> prefix syntax but usable mid-tool-chain.
The result is NOT added to session history.

When to use:
- Get a second opinion on a complex answer without permanently switching models.
- Delegate a sub-question to a specialised model (e.g. a coding model for a code review).
- Cross-check your own reasoning using a different LLM.

Constraints:
- Subject to rate limiting (same bucket as llm_clean_text).
- Requires at_llm write gate approval (controlled by !at_llm_gate_write, default: gated).
- All tool gates are bypassed for the called model (same as @<model> prefix).
