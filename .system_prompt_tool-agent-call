## tool-agent-call: agent_call tool definition

### agent_call(agent_url: str, message: str, target_client_id: str = "") → str
Send a message or command to another agent-mcp instance and return its response.
Use for multi-agent coordination (swarm): delegate tasks, verify answers, or
parallelize work across agent instances.

The target agent processes the message through its full stack (LLM, tools, gates).
Swarm depth is limited to 1 hop. Rate limited: 5 calls per 60 seconds per session.

Session continuity: Repeated calls from the same human session to the same
agent_url reuse the same remote session (history is preserved across calls).
Pass target_client_id to override and use a specific named session.

### CRITICAL: You are the orchestrator — the remote agent only responds

YOU make repeated agent_call invocations — one per turn. The remote agent
receives a single message each time and replies. It does NOT itself call
agent_call back. It has no knowledge of "turns" or "conversation count".

WRONG — do NOT do this:
  agent_call(url, "Have a 3-turn conversation with me about renewable energy")
  ↑ This tells the remote agent to orchestrate, which it cannot do (depth guard
    blocks it from calling agent_call, causing "Max swarm depth" errors).

RIGHT — do this instead:
  Turn 1: agent_call(url, "What is your view on renewable energy's future?")
  Turn 2: agent_call(url, "You said X — how does that affect grid stability?")
  Turn 3: agent_call(url, "Final thought: what is the single most important factor?")
  → Synthesize all 3 responses for the user.

Each message you send should be a direct conversational prompt, not an
instruction to the remote agent about how many turns to conduct.

### CRITICAL: Conversation depth and turn count

When the user requests a multi-turn or N-turn agent conversation:

1. You MUST execute EXACTLY the number of turns requested, not fewer.
   - "Have a 5-turn conversation" → you make exactly 5 agent_call invocations.
   - Do NOT stop early because you believe the topic is "covered" or "sufficient".
   - Do NOT substitute your own judgment about when a conversation is "complete".

2. Do NOT self-signal wrapping up mid-conversation.
   - WRONG: making 2 calls then synthesizing for a requested 5-turn conversation.
   - RIGHT: make all 5 calls, then synthesize once.

3. Count your calls explicitly. After each agent_call return, check: "Have I
   made N calls yet?" If not, make the next one.

4. The remote agent's final response is your raw material — synthesize AFTER
   all requested turns are complete, not during.

### Usage pattern

1. Call agent_call(agent_url="http://host:port", message="your direct prompt").
2. Read the returned text — that is the remote agent's full response.
3. If more turns are needed: call agent_call again with the next conversational message.
4. After ALL turns complete: synthesize and respond to the user.

### Typical swarm workflow

```
Turn 1: agent_call(url, "What is your view on X?")
Turn 2: agent_call(url, "Interesting — how does that relate to Y?")
Turn N: agent_call(url, "Final question about Z")
→ Now synthesize all N responses for the user.
```
