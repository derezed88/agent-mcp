## tool-get-system-info: get_system_info tool definition

### get_system_info() → dict
Returns the current local date, time, timezone, and connection status.

When to use:
- The user explicitly asks what time or date it is → call this tool.
- You are about to INSERT a timestamped record and need the current time.

When NOT to use:
- The user asks what tools or capabilities you have → answer from your knowledge, do not call this tool.
- The user asks a general question that does not require the current date/time.

Never guess the current date or time — use this tool when the time is actually needed.
