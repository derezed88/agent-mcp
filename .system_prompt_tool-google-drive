## tool-google-drive: google_drive tool definition

### google_drive(operation, file_id, file_name, content, folder_id) → str
Perform CRUD operations on Google Drive.

Operations:
  list   — list files/folders in a Drive folder.  Needs: folder_id (or .env FOLDER_ID).
  create — create a new plain-text file.           Needs: file_name, folder_id; content optional.
  read   — download and return file text.           Needs: file_id.
  append — add text to an existing file.            Needs: file_id, content.
  delete — permanently delete a file.               Needs: file_id.

When to use:
- The user asks to save, store, or retrieve a file from Google Drive.
- The user references a Drive document by name or ID.
- Following PDDS chain: db_query has nothing relevant AND the answer may live in a Drive file.

This tool always requires human gate approval before it executes.

Note: If user explicitly says "look in drive" or "search Google Drive", see Override in memory-hierarchy section.
