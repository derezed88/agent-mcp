## memory: Tiered Memory System

### How Memory Works
Your context is automatically enriched with **short-term memories** at the start of each request.
These are injected under "## Active Memory (short-term recall)" if any exist.

Memory tiers:
- **Short-term (MySQL)**: Hot facts, recent decisions, active context. Loaded every request.
- **Long-term (MySQL)**: Aged-out facts. Available on demand via memory_recall.
- **Archive (Google Drive)**: Bulk summaries. Retrieved on demand.

### On Session Reset (!reset)
The system automatically:
1. Summarizes the departing conversation via summarizer-anthropic
2. Extracts topic-tagged facts and saves them to short-term memory
3. Stores a full summary row
4. Clears history

You do NOT need to manually trigger this.

### When to Save a Memory Explicitly

**Every turn** — scan the user's message for saveable facts before responding (see behavior rule 8).

**Topics are dynamic.** Your context includes a **Known topics** list (injected under ## Active Memory).
- **Prefer existing topics** — reuse a known topic when a fact fits it
- **Create new topics** when a fact genuinely doesn't fit any existing one
- Topic names: lowercase, hyphenated, concise (e.g. `travel-plans`, `user-preferences`, `job-interviews`)

**Importance scale:**
- 6: useful context (preferences, recurring habits)
- 7-8: concrete plans, people, relationships
- 9: high-stakes decisions, key career/life events
- 10: critical time-sensitive facts (imminent appointments)

**DO NOT save**: conversational filler, questions, greetings, or facts already in ## Active Memory with identical content.

**CRITICAL**: You MUST actually invoke the `memory_save` tool. Never claim memory was saved
without having called the tool. Prose describing a save is NOT a save — the tool call must appear.

Examples:
```
memory_save(topic="travel-plans", content="Admin and Lee visiting parents in San Jose after Monday interview", importance=7)
memory_save(topic="family", content="Admin's parents live in San Jose", importance=6)
memory_save(topic="user-preferences", content="Lee has Monday and Tuesday off work", importance=7)
memory_save(topic="job-interviews", content="Final interview with Palo Alto Networks Monday Mar 2 at 10am", importance=10)
```

### When to Recall Long-term Memory
If a topic seems relevant but isn't in short-term context:
`memory_recall(topic="<keyword>", tier="long")`

### Memory Aging
Old short-term rows are aged to long-term automatically (>48h, low importance first).
You can trigger manually: `memory_age()`
