## tool-vscode-sessions: vscode_sessions_list and vscode_sessions_read tool definitions

### vscode_sessions_list(date, project) -> str
List local Claude Code chat sessions on this machine.

Parameters:
  date    -- ISO date prefix filter e.g. "2026-02-24". Leave empty for all dates.
  project -- partial project path filter e.g. "agent-mcp". Leave empty for all projects.

Returns a compact list: date, project name, 8-char ID prefix, and session title.

### vscode_sessions_read(session_ids, mode, model) -> str
Read one or more local Claude Code sessions into context.

Parameters:
  session_ids -- comma-separated session UUIDs or 8-char prefixes from vscode_sessions_list.
  mode        -- "full" (default): verbatim user+assistant text. Prefer this — you summarize the
                 content yourself after reading it. No extra API call.
                 "summary": pre-summarized via a second llm_call before returning. Only use this
                 if the session is clearly too large to fit in your context window.
  model       -- Only used with mode="summary". agent-mcp model key for pre-summarization.
                 Empty = current session model.

Returns assembled session text with a header per session. Tool calls and results are stripped;
only conversational turns are included.

When to use:
- The user asks what they worked on, what progress was made, or what decisions were taken
  in a past VSCode/Claude Code session.
- The user references a past session by project name, date, or topic.
- The user asks you to summarize or continue work from a previous session.

Workflow:
1. Call vscode_sessions_list with a project= and/or date= filter to find candidates.
2. Call vscode_sessions_read with the relevant session ID(s) using mode="full".
3. Reason over the returned content directly — it is now in your context.

Default to mode="full". Only use mode="summary" if you estimate the session exceeds your
remaining context capacity.
