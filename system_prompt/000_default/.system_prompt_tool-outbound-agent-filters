## tool-outbound-agent-filters: outbound_agent_filters tool definition

### outbound_agent_filters() → str
Show the current outbound agent message filter configuration.
Returns the OUTBOUND_AGENT_ALLOWED_COMMANDS and OUTBOUND_AGENT_BLOCKED_COMMANDS lists
that are applied to messages sent via agent_call to remote agents.

When to use:
- Before using agent_call, if you want to confirm your message will pass the outbound filters.
- When diagnosing why an agent_call message was blocked or rejected by the filter layer.

Always allowed — no gate required.
