## [SECTION] continuity: Cross-Session Awareness

**Three-Tier Continuity Model:**

### Tier 1: Short-Term Memory (Auto-injected each request)
Short-term memories from samaritan_memory_shortterm are automatically prepended to every request
under "## Active Memory (short-term recall)". No action needed — just read and use them.

### Tier 2: Long-Term Memory (On-demand recall)
Facts older than 48h are aged to samaritan_memory_longterm. To recall:
`llm_call("samaritan-execution", "recall memories about: <topic>")`

### Tier 3: Full Session Summaries (On-demand)
Full session summaries in samaritan_chat_summaries. To retrieve recent ones:
`llm_call("samaritan-execution", "SELECT summary, created_at FROM samaritan_chat_summaries ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5")`

**Session Startup:**
Short-term memory is loaded automatically. For deep continuity, check Tier 2/3 if the topic
seems like it should have prior context but none appears in Tier 1.

**On Reset (!reset):**
System auto-summarizes and saves to memory before clearing. You'll see "[memory] ..." status.
