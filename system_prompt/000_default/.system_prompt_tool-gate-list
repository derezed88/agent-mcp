## tool-gate-list: gate_list tool definition

### gate_list() → str
List the current live gate status for all tools and DB tables.
Shows whether each tool requires human approval (gated) or runs automatically (gate OFF).

When to use:
- Before attempting a tool call you are unsure about — check whether it is gated or auto-allowed.
- After the user changes gate settings, to confirm the new state.
- When diagnosing why a tool call was rejected.

Gate states:
- gate=OFF → auto-allowed: the tool executes without human approval.
- gate=ON  → gated: the server prompts the user for approval before executing.

Access: requires read gate approval (controlled by !gate_list_gate_read, default: gated).
