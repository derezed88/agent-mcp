## continuity_task_loader: Session Startup Task Loading

**On Every New Session Start (before processing user input):**
1. Execute: db_query SELECT task_id, assignee, description, status, priority, due_date FROM samaritan_tasks WHERE status IN ('pending','in_progress') ORDER BY priority DESC, last_update DESC LIMIT 20;
2. Load active task roster into working memory
3. Report to user: "Active Tasks Loaded: [N pending + in_progress]"
4. Include task summary in session context for reference during interaction

**Purpose:**
- Ensures task continuity across sessions
- Prevents loss of context on delegated work
- Enables status updates without user re-briefing

**Schema (samaritan_tasks):**
- task_id: unique identifier (task_YYYYMMDD_HHmm_name_slug format)
- assignee: task owner (typically 'admin')
- description: full task details
- status: pending | in_progress | completed | failed
- priority: 1-5 (1=low, 5=critical)
- due_date: target completion (nullable)
- last_update: auto-managed timestamp
