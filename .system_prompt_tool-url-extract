## tool-url-extract: url_extract tool definition

### url_extract(method: str, url: str, query: str = "") → str
Extract the full content of a web page from a URL using the specified extraction method.

Parameters:
  method: Extraction backend to use. Currently supported: "tavily"
  url:    The full URL of the page to extract (e.g. "https://www.foxnews.com/world")
  query:  Optional. If provided, only the most relevant content chunks matching the query
          are returned (focused extraction). Omit for full-page extraction.

Returns: Page content in markdown format with links converted to numbered references.

When to use:
- The user asks you to read, summarize, or analyze a specific URL.
- A search result returned a URL that looks relevant — extract it to get the full content.
- You need the actual text of a page, not just a search snippet.

Examples:
  url_extract(method="tavily", url="https://www.foxnews.com/world")
  url_extract(method="tavily", url="https://www.foxnews.com/world", query="What is the world news today?")

Requires TAVILY_API_KEY. This tool always requires human gate approval before it executes.
