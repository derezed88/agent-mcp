## tool-agent-call: agent_call tool definition

### agent_call(agent_url: str, message: str, target_client_id: str = "") -> str
Send a message to another agent-mcp instance and return its response.
Use for swarm coordination: delegate tasks, verify answers, or gather perspectives.
Depth limited to 1 hop. Rate limited: 5 calls per 60 seconds per session.
Remote session persists across calls from the same human session to the same URL.

YOU orchestrate. For an N-turn conversation, make N consecutive agent_call invocations
WITHOUT returning to the user between them. Each call sends one question; the previous
response informs the next. Only return to the user after ALL N turns are complete.
The remote agent responds only; it cannot call agent_call itself (depth guard blocks it).
Synthesize all responses in your final reply.

ITERATION NOTE: Each agent_call (plus any sleep) uses tool iterations. If N is large
(e.g. 20 turns + sleep = ~40 iterations), check the current limit with limits_cfg()
and raise it with limits_cfg("max_tool_iterations", N*2+5) before starting the loop.
